#CNN 


for running the code refer to readme file.

This assignment is a work under the course cs6910 under the prof. Mithesh Kabhra from IIT Madras. This assigment is an individual assignment. 

Through this assignment, I have learned about cnn, their implementation, limitations, and use of pretrained models to improve the accuracy on a dataset.

I have also implemented YOLOV3 on a video for traffic survallance through which I have detected objects such as cars, trucks, person, traffic signals, etc. 
A report has been submitted in the course submission which depicts the undestanding of the concepts in the same.
