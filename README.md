# assignment-2-CNN



for running the code, refer to the readme(PDF) file.

This assignment is a work under the course cs6910 under Prof. Mithesh Kabhra from IIT Madras. This assignment is an individual assignment. 

Through this assignment, I have learned about CNN, its implementation, limitations, and the use of pre-trained models to improve the accuracy of a dataset.

I have also implemented YOLOV3 on a video for traffic surveillance through which I have detected objects such as cars, trucks, people, traffic signals, etc. 
A report has been submitted in the course submission, which depicts the understanding of the concepts in the same. Detailed explanation for the YOLOV3 architecture and this project pipeline can be found at this link: https://medium.com/@ravinarai123/object-detection-using-yolov3-7366c0215951
